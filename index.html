<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>My name is William Antonio Molina Jr, I go to Lewis University as a freshman, class of 2025.I will be majoring in Cybersecurity, but I have been thinking of double majoring in IT.
    I was born in Chicago, Illinois, I went to school to Daniel Zizumbo Charter School, which was named by a fallen veteran in the war on terror.
    I am half Mexican and half Nicaraguan, my dad is from Nicaragua, and my mom is from San Luis Potsui, Mexico.
    I have 6 siblings, 5 sisters and 1 brother, they all like to fight me for fun, but I love them cause they are my family.
    I do know, that for cybersecurity, they make so much money. From what I researched, they make around 90,000 to 160,000.
